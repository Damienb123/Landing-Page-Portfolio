## Overview
- As my first official project as a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI, I developed a personal portfolio landing page built with front end
languages such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and with some use of jQuery on Visual Studio Code. This project took some inspiration from the resource page HTML5 UP! using
a template called "Strata" that seemed suitable, modern, and appealing to user's or most importantly, recruiters when catching their attention getting to know me and showcasing my skills.
